Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 1.12.0 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux


I am pleased to announce the availability of 
   mdadm version 1.12.0
It is available at
   http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
and
   http://www.{countrycode}.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/

as a source tar-ball and (at the first site) as an SRPM, and as an RPM for i386.

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 1.12.0 adds:
  Several of these are backported from the Debian package
    -   Don't use 'lstat' to check for blockdevices, use stat.
    -   Get size calculation right when in Create when BLKGESIZE64 not available
    -   Document --size=max option for --grow
    -   Document SparesMissing event and DeviceDisappeared/WrongLevel
    -   --stop --scan repeatly cycles until no more progress can be made
	so that stack devices are stopped properly
    -   Minor type rationalisation for ident->uuid - now always 'int[]'
    -   Fix type in online help for --grow (was -F, now -G)
    -   Allow --auto command line option to set default auto=
	value when running "--assemble --scan".  Previously
	--auto was ignored if --scan was given
    -   Fix a few type casts
    -   Fix parsing of /dev/md/N in is_standard
    -   Fix rounding errors in human_size()
    -   Fix silly example in mdadm.conf-examples
    -   When finding a /dev name for a device, prefer shorter names
    -   Suppress listing of devices= in --brief output of -D or -E,
	unless -v is given (-vv gives the old behaviour with -Dsv).
	This is because the device list can change and so is not a
	stable aspect of the array
    -   Allow --force with --grow so '-Gfn1' works (on raid1)
    -   Make --examine --brief report spares= properly.
    -   When device files are made with "--assemble --auto",
	add them to the list of known device name, so that 
	assembling stacked devices has a better chance of working.
    -   Replace sprintf calls with snprintf (to quiet diet-libc)
    -   Add man page for mdassemble
    -   Fix compilation with tinyc
    -   Lot of minor manpage updates
